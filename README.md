# MyEpitechProjects
This is a collection of the projects I created during my time at Epitech Berlin.
Keep in mind that all of these projects were due until a certain deadline. That's why some of them are unfinished or have smaller issues.
Also there are a few projects that were done as group projects (most of the time those with a different name).

Additionally there was a specific coding style requested - which caused some questionable constructions and no documentation.
